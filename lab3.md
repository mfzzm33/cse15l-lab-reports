# Lab Report 3 
## Bugs and Commands

### Part 1 - Bugs
A failure-inducing input for the buggy program is shown below:
```
  @Test
  public void testReversed2() {
    int[] input1 = {1,2,3};
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3,2,1}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```
The integer array includes three elements, and when we try to reverse it, the output array only reverse half of the array while the other 
Below is another Junit test, which does not induce a failure. The empty array in this case is empty.
```
  @Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input1 = { };
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```
The test below suggests that the `reversed` method is able to return an array but in an incorrect format. 
As shown in the screenshot of the symptoms below, of the two tests, one passed, and the other one failed. It shows that at least one of the element in the output array 
differs from the expected array.

Now we will look at the code part and catch the bug.
This the original code, which failed the test.
```
  // Returns a *new* array with all the elements of the input array in reversed
  // order
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```
There is a bug in the following line:
```
arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
```
This line is trying to set the (i)th element in the original array `arr` which is wrong. It means the reversed elements are being put back into the original array `arr`, 
rather than the new array `newArray`.

The corrected function would look something like:
```
static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
  int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
  for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
    newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
  }
  return newArray;
}
```
This line correctly sets the (i)th position in the new array `newArray` as the reversed element from the original array `arr`.


### Part 2 - Research Commands

1. **-i flag:** This flag makes grep case insensitive.

***Example 1:*** Here we try the `grep` command both with and without the `-i` flag to find the string `study` in the file `technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt`.
   The word count of the strings found in the case insensitive case is greater than the one case sensitive.
```

        events [ 10 ] . In this paper we study whether BMI at
          population-based longitudinal study of 5,888 adults aged
        from EVGFP) in the first seven years of the study, adjusted

(base) MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % wc -w find_word.txt 
      31 find_word.txt
(base) MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep -i "study" technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt > find_word2.txt
(base) MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % wc -w find_word2.txt
      48 find_word2.txt
```

***Example 2:*** Here we use the case insensitive grep command to find the string `health` from all the text files under the directory `technical/biomed`. 
As shown in the first ten outputs, there are both string `health` in upper- and lower-case forms.

```
(base) MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep -i "health" technical/biomed/*.txt > health.txt
(base) MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % head -10 < health.txt
technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt:        Many healthy older adults report gradual weight gain
technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt:        most robust health as we age. It has been suggested that

technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt:        they were evaluated on improved health, rather than on

technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt:          which the person was 'healthy', and is similar in concept
```

2. **-r flag:** This flag tells grep to read all files under each directory, recursively.

***Example 3:*** The example shows that the strings `base pair` under the `technical` directory are found under different directories, 
some under `biomed`, some under `plos` directory.
```
(base) MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep -r "base pair" technical/ > output.txt
(base) MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % head -10 < output.txt

```

***Example 4:*** The example shows that the strings `Cardiovascular` under the `technical/biomed` directory are found under different text files.
```
(base) MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep -r "Cardiovascular" technical/biomed > output.txt

```

3. ***-v flag:*** This flag inverts the search, returning all lines that do not contain the pattern.

***Example 5:*** In this example, the `grep` command would output the lines without the string `and` under the file `technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt`. 
We search the string `and` in the output text file and no lines is returned, and when we use the `-v` flag again, the whole content in the output file is returned.
```
(base) MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep -v "and" technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt > output.txt
(base) MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep "and" output.txt
(base) MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep -v "and" output.txt

        unequivocally demonstrated that 3-Hydroxy-3-methylgluatryl
        coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce
        disease. These trials found that when compared with
        placebo, statins significantly reduced the incidence of
        death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous
        persons with ...
```

***Example 6:*** In this example, the `grep` command would output the lines without the string `problem` under the file `technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt`. 
The string `problem` is selected from the first line of the file, and the output content returned the lines starting from the second lines, which verify that 
the lines with the string `problem` is not outputed.
```
MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep -v "problem" technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt

        coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce
        the morbidity and mortality associated with coronary
        disease. These trials found that when compared with ...
```
4. ***-l flag:*** This flag tells grep to print out only the names of files that contain the specific pattern.

***Example 7:*** In this example, the `grep`command is used to find the string `coenzyme A` from all the text files under the directory `technical/biomed`.
Without the `-l` flag, all the lines that contain the string `coenzyme A` is listed, including the information of the file it is from and the content of the line.
With the `-l` flag, it only shows the name of the files that include the string `coenzyme A`. Unlike the one without the flag, each filename is shown once only.
```
(base) MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep "coenzyme A" technical/biomed/*.txt > output.txt

technical/biomed/1476-511X-1-2.txt
```

***Example 8:*** In this example, the `grep` command returns the name of the files that contain the string `institute`  from all the text files under the directory `technical/plos`.
```
(base) MayZhang@s-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep -l "institute" technical/plos/*.txt
